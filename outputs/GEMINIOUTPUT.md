Initial OS Feedback:\n\n1. Command Argument Clarity: It was initially challenging to determine the correct argument names for commands like `READ_FILE` and `WRITE_FILE`. The error messages were sometimes generic (e.g., 'Invalid argument limited') which didn't immediately pinpoint the issue.\n\n2. The `HELP` Command is Crucial: The `HELP` command proved invaluable in clarifying command syntax and arguments. Its detailed output quickly resolved the issues I encountered.\n\n3. Suggestion: Consider making error messages more specific about argument names when they are incorrect, or provide examples in the `HELP` output for each command.\n\nOverall, the OS sandbox provides the necessary tools, but the learning curve for precise command usage can be steep without frequent consultation of the `HELP` command.
