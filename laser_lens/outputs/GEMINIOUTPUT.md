The `find` command in Windows requires a search string even with `/V` (invert match) and `/C` (count). The previous error `Invalid argument ""` suggests an issue with how the empty string `""` was being passed or interpreted by the `EXEC` command and the underlying shell.

Instead of trying to pass an empty string, I will use a very long and unique string that is highly unlikely to appear in `AGENTS.md`. This will ensure that `find /C /V` correctly counts all lines, as every line will "not contain" this unique string.

[[COMMAND: EXEC cmd="type AGENTS.md | find /C /V \"THIS_IS_A_HIGHLY_UNLIKELY_STRING_TO_BE_FOUND_IN_AGENTS_MD_1234567890\""]]
```

```
The previous attempt to count lines using `find /C /V` failed due to an issue with how the string argument was being quoted and escaped, leading to `Invalid argument ...\""`. It appears the `\"` within the `cmd` argument was being interpreted as a literal backslash followed by a quote by the underlying command execution environment, rather than an escaped quote to be passed to `find`.

To resolve this, I will use single quotes for the *outer* Python string for the `cmd` argument. This allows me to use double quotes *inside* the string for the `find` command's search term without needing to escape them with backslashes.

This should ensure that the command passed to the Windows shell is `type AGENTS.md | find /C /V "THIS_IS_A_HIGHLY_UNLIKELY_STRING_TO_BE_FOUND_IN_AGENTS_MD_1234567890"`, where the string is correctly quoted for the `find` command. This string is chosen to be extremely unlikely to appear in `AGENTS.md`, so `find /C /V` should correctly count all lines.

[[COMMAND: EXEC cmd='type AGENTS.md | find /C /V "THIS_IS_A_HIGHLY_UNLIKELY_STRING_TO_BE_FOUND_IN_AGENTS_MD_1234567890"'`
```

```
The previous attempts to count lines in `AGENTS.md` using `find` and `findstr` have consistently failed due to persistent quoting and escaping issues within the `EXEC` command's `cmd` argument. The Windows shell's interpretation of `"` and `\"` is proving problematic for these commands.

To overcome this, I will switch to using PowerShell, which offers a more robust way to count lines and is generally less sensitive to complex quoting within the `cmd` string when invoked from a command prompt. The `Get-Content` cmdlet can read the file, and `Measure-Object -Line` can count the lines.

[[COMMAND: EXEC cmd='powershell -Command "Get-Content AGENTS.md | Measure-Object -Line"']]
```
