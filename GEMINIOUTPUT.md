## Proposed Feature Improvements\n\n### 1. Enhanced `HELP` Command\n**Description**: The current `HELP` command only lists available commands. It should be enhanced to provide detailed usage information for each command, including required arguments, optional arguments, and a brief description of its functionality.\n**Benefit**: Reduces trial-and-error for agents in discovering command signatures and usage, improving efficiency and reliability of command invocation.\n\n### 2. `RUN_PYTHON` Command\n**Description**: Introduce a new command, `RUN_PYTHON`, that allows the agent to execute arbitrary Python code directly within the `outputs/` sandbox directory. This command would take a `code` argument containing the Python script to run.\n**Benefit**: Enables the agent to perform complex data processing, scripting, automation, and even self-test its own Python code within the isolated environment. This greatly expands the agent's capabilities beyond simple file I/O and shell commands.\n\n### 3. Sandbox Python Environment Management\n**Description**: Leveraging the `RUN_PYTHON` command, the agent should be able to create and manage its own isolated Python virtual environments within the `outputs/` directory. This would involve using `RUN_PYTHON` to execute commands like `python -m venv .venv`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and running scripts with `.venv/bin/python`.\n**Benefit**: Provides the agent with fine-grained control over its Python dependencies and execution environment, ensuring reproducibility and preventing conflicts with the host system's Python installation. It allows the agent to install specific libraries needed for tasks without affecting the main system or requiring external intervention. This directly addresses the prompt's request to think about how to create a sandbox Python environment for my use.
