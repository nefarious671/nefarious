# Recursive Analysis of Test and review this recursive operating system. suggest improvements for codex to implement. at the end of the loop provide and updated version of attached AGENTS.md for further development. Give the final output in chat due to inconsistency with file I/O bugs.

```
The `LS` command successfully listed the contents of the `outputs/` directory, confirming the functionality of the `LS` alias for `LIST_OUTPUTS`. This completes the testing for `Phase 2-B: Alias Commands for OS-feel`.

Now, I will proceed to test `Phase 2-A: Add Sandbox EXEC Command`. I will execute a simple `echo` command to verify that `EXEC` can run commands within the specified `SAFE_OUTPUT_DIR` and capture its output.

[[COMMAND: EXEC command="echo \"Hello from EXEC!\""]]
```

```
The previous attempt to use `EXEC` failed because I used `command` instead of `cmd` for the argument name. I need to correct this.

Now, I will re-attempt to test `Phase 2-A: Add Sandbox EXEC Command` by executing a simple `echo` command, ensuring I use `cmd="<command_string>"`. This will verify that `EXEC` can run commands within `SAFE_OUTPUT_DIR` and capture its output.

[[COMMAND: EXEC cmd="echo \"Hello from EXEC!\""]]
```

```
The `EXEC` command failed again, and the truncated output prevents me from seeing the specific error. Before retrying, I need to confirm the correct syntax and available commands. I will use the `HELP` command, as outlined in Phase 7-2, to get details on the environment and supported commands. This will help me understand why `EXEC` is failing and how to use it correctly.

[[COMMAND: HELP]]
```
